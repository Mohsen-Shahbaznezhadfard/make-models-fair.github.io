  Process for making a model FAIR
---

Living doc -- ever changing.

Each model in the initiative has been assessed based on the five FAIR criteria (link here).

Steps in the process:
1. Original assessment of FAIR-ness (done by CoMSES team)
2. Make model FAIR (using the 5 criteria) -- re-assess FAIR-ness based on community efforts, etc.
3. Replication check -- can you reproduce results
4. Robustness check -- sensitivity tests, parameter sweeps
  * High throughput computing, etc.
