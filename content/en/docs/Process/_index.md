  Process for making a model FAIR
---

For each of the five FAIR criteria considered, we provide guidance on how to meet those criteria. Those guidelines will be updated based on the experience during this initiative. We recommend to use the GitHub repository of the model aligned with the publication in this website. Create new issues in the associated GitHub repository to document the action you are taking,

* __Criteria 1.__ Code is not available in a publicly accessible repository.

Contact authors and inquire about the availability of the original code of the model.

IF they provide the code, ask whether it is OK to make the code publicly available.

IF code is not findable (or authors do not want to make their code being publicly available), try to replicate the code from the model description of the publication (using the github repository on this website)

Can you replicate the basic results published in the publocation?

* __Criteria 2.__ The model code has no license.

Give it a license. If you received the code from the authors on the selection of the license.

* __Criteria 3.__ The mode code repository has no DOI

Archive the model code in an archive that provides a DOI.

* __Criteria 4.__ Documentation quality can be improved.

Improve the model description. For example, describe purpose, use flow diagrams, use equations and pseudo code, describe submodels. Provide sources of datasets used by the model. In principle the model could be replicated from the model documentation.

* __Criteria 5.__ Code is not sufficiently cleaned up and commented.

Clean up the code by removing outcommenting code, provide clear variable names, comment on the meaning of each procedure, remove.
