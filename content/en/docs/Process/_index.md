Here, you will find guidance on how this initiative seeks to make models more FAIR. This effort will contribute a public good to the modeling community, increasing transparency and building trust in many of the highly cited models that are frequently used (and built upon) in new research. While __the initiative is primarily focused on the first two steps outlined below__, it will open the door for replication and robustness checks and other associated opportunities.

Each publication (and associated model) originally selected for this initiative has been assessed based on the five FAIR criteria: (1) Publicly accessible code, (2) License for the code, (3) DOI for the code, (4) Good documentation, and (5) Clean code.

#### __Steps in the process:__
1. __Original assessment of the FAIR criteria__ <br>_See [Assess a Model](/docs/process/assessment/) for more information_
    - This is done by the CoMSES team for the preliminary models for this initiative
    - See the [Models](/docs/models/) page for each model's assessment score

    <br>
2. __Make the model FAIR (across the five criteria)__ <br>_See [How to Make FAIR](/docs/process/how-to/) for more information_
    - Periodically re-assess the five FAIR criteria of the model you're working on
    - Contact fair@comses.net and/or comment on the model's issue within the coordination repository when this process has been completed

    <br>
3. __Replication check__
    - Can you reproduce the originally-published results?

    <br>
4. __Robustness check__
    - Sensitivity tests, parameter sweeps
    - Opportunities to utilize high throughput computing, etc.
