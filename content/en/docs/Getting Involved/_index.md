## __How to get started__

Are you ready to contribute to increasing the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reproducibility (FAIR) of one or more highly cited and well-known models in the social ecological sciences? Below is a checklist detailing the steps to getting started!

1. [Check out the models](/docs/getting-involved/checklist/#one)
2. [Identify what you'd like to work on](/docs/getting-involved/checklist/#two)
3. [Get set up on GitHub](/docs/getting-involved/checklist/#three)
4. [Create or contribute to a GitHub issue](/docs/getting-involved/checklist/#four)
5. [Update issue labels](/docs/getting-involved/checklist/#five)
6. [Get to work!](/docs/getting-involved/checklist/#six)

## __Ways to get involved__
This initiative is being built from the ground up, to support capacity-building efforts, foster networking opportunities, and involve the modeling community in the development of a public good.

There are many ways that you may wish to join the initiative, such as:
* Assigning models in courses you teach
* Designing and implementing replication projects
* Exploring the robustness of highly cited models through parameter sweeps or other sensitivity tests
* Assessing the FAIR-ness of your own models
* Utilizing high throughput computing resources for a selection of highly cited, newly FAIR models
