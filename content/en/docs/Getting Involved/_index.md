## __How to get started__

Are you ready to contribute to increasing the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reproducibility (FAIR) of one or more highly cited and well-known models in the social ecological sciences? Below is a checklist detailing the steps to getting started!

1. Check out the publications (and the associated models) currently selected for inclusion in this initiative on the [Models](/docs/models/) page.
2. On the Models page, you will find a table with initial assessments of each model's "scores" on the five FAIR criteria, their current status in the making FAIR process, and a link to the associated issue in the [coordination repository](https://github.com/make-models-fair/coordination/issues).
3. For any model you are interested in, navigate to the issue in the [coordination repository](https://github.com/make-models-fair/coordination/issues). Here, you will see if any others have begun work on making the model FAIR, or if you are the first!
4. Write a note in the issue to indicate your intention to work on this model, and provide any other relevant details on your anticipated timeline or process for doing so. Be sure to update the labels to indicate the status (e.g., change the yellow label from "Contributors needed" to "In progress").
5. If the model has not yet had any contributors, create a new model repository using this [candidate model template](https://github.com/make-models-fair/candidate-model-template). Name the repository based on the publication citation associated with the model using the following guidelines:
    - _One author:_ name-year
      - Example: zhang-2004
    - _Two authors:_ name1-name2-year
      - Example: zhang-smith-2004
    - _Three or more authors:_ name1-etal-year
      - Example: zhang-etal-2004
6. Get to work! You may use the checklist from the model repository's README file to go through the process of making a model FAIR outlined on the [Process](/docs/process/) page.

### An example

As an example, let's take a look at the Nowak & Sigmund (1998) publication.  


## __Ways to get involved__
This initiative is being built from the ground up, to support capacity-building efforts, foster networking opportunities, and involve the modeling community in the development of a public good.

There are many ways that you may wish to join the initiative, such as:
* Assigning models in courses you teach
* Designing and implementing replication projects
* Exploring the robustness of highly cited models through parameter sweeps or other sensitivity tests
* Assessing the FAIR-ness of your own models
* Utilizing high throughput computing resources for a selection of highly cited, newly FAIR models
