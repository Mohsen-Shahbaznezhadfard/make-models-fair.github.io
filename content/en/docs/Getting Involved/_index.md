## __How to get started__

Are you ready to contribute to increasing the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reproducibility (FAIR) of one or more highly cited and well-known models in the social ecological sciences? Below is a checklist detailing the steps to getting started!

1. [Check out the models](/docs/getting-involved/#one)
2. [Identify what you'd like to work on](/docs/getting-involved/#two)
3. [Create or contribute to a GitHub issue](/docs/getting-involved/#three)
4. [Update issue labels](/docs/getting-involved/#four)
5. [Get to work!](/docs/getting-involved/#five)

<hr>

##### __1. Check out the models currently selected for inclusion in this initiative on the [Models](/docs/models/) page.__ {#one}
  * On the Models page, you will find links to the four categories of models that have been preliminarily selected for inclusion -- Ecological Processes, Land Use, Cooperation, and Crowd Dynamics. Each category has between 20-25 model publications associated with it.
  <br>
  <br>
  * Each category has a sub-page with a table identifying the [initial assessments](/docs/process/assessment) of each model's "scores" on the five FAIR criteria, their current status in the making FAIR process (e.g., "Not yet started", "In process"), and a link to an associated issue in the [GitHub coordination repository](https://github.com/make-models-fair/coordination/issues) if the model is "In process".
    * Note: a small selection of "Not yet started" models already have Github issue trackers associated with them, to illustrate how the process will look.

<hr>

##### __2. Identify what you'd like to work on! If you'd prefer to suggest a different model, please refer to our guidance on [how to suggest a new model](/docs/models/#new).__ {#two}
  * Note: for any newly suggested model, you will need to first [assess the model publication](/docs/process/assessment) on the five FAIR criteria.

<hr>

##### __3. For any model you are interested in, create or contribute to an associated issue in the [coordination repository](https://github.com/make-models-fair/coordination/issues).__ {#three}
  * This is where you will track and document progress and collaborate with others. If there is alreasy an existing issue for the model you're interested in, there should be a link in the associated column in the table listing of models.
  <br>
  <br>
  * If the model has not yet had any contributors, create a new issue in the [coordination repository](https://github.com/make-models-fair/coordination/issues).
    * Name the issue based on the publication citation associated with the model using the following guidelines:
      - _One author:_ name-year
        - Example: zhang-2004
      - _Two authors:_ name1-name2-year
        - Example: zhang-smith-2004
      - _Three or more authors:_ name1-etal-year
        - Example: zhang-etal-2004

<hr>

##### __4. Write a note in the issue & update the labels.__ {#four}
  * Write a note in the issue to indicate your intention to work on this model, and provide any other relevant details on your anticipated timeline or process for doing so.
  <br>
  <br>
  * Be sure to update the labels to indicate the status by selecting either (or both) the "In progress" or "Collaborators needed" labels for the issue.
    * *This is a very important step, as the label "In progress" will trigger an automated email to fair@comses.net asking for a new model repository to be created for this model using the same publication-based naming convention as above (e.g., name-year).

<hr>

##### 5. __Get to work!__ {#five}
  * You will get a notification on your associated issue that there is a new model repository ready for your use. In the meantime, use the documentation on the [Process](/docs/process/) and [How to Make FAIR](/docs/process/how-to) pages as a checklist.
  <br>
  <br>
  * Once you have received notification of your new model repository, please follow the instructions and guidelines on the repository's README file for more information on using GitHub for collaboration (i.e., forking the repository, submitting pull requests), the process for making models FAIR, suggestions for the repository file structure, and using the issue tracker for documentation of progress.

### An example

As an example, let's take a look at the Nowak & Sigmund (1998) publication.  


## __Ways to get involved__
This initiative is being built from the ground up, to support capacity-building efforts, foster networking opportunities, and involve the modeling community in the development of a public good.

There are many ways that you may wish to join the initiative, such as:
* Assigning models in courses you teach
* Designing and implementing replication projects
* Exploring the robustness of highly cited models through parameter sweeps or other sensitivity tests
* Assessing the FAIR-ness of your own models
* Utilizing high throughput computing resources for a selection of highly cited, newly FAIR models
