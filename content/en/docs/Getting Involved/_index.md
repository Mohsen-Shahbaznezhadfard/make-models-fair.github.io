## How to get started

1. Check out the publications and their associated models currently selected for inclusion in this initiative on the [Models](/docs/models/) page. Here, you will find a table of models with their current status, and a link to their GitHub repository where the collaboration is taking place.
2. If you wish to contribute to one of these models, select the model and navigate to its repository.
3. See the repository's discussion section for a pinned conversation titled "Collaboration Opt-In." In this section, you should be able to get a sense of others who are working on this model, or if you're the first!
4. Write a note in this section to indicate your intention to work on this model, and provide any other relevant details on your anticipated timeline or process for doing so.
5. Under the issue tracker, you will find any updates to the process of making the model FAIR itself. For instance, if the publication author has been contacted but was not able to provide code, this should be noted as an issue.

### An example

As an example, let's take a look at the repository for Nowak et al. (1998).

## Ways to get involved
This initiative is being built from the ground up, to support capacity-building efforts, foster networking opportunities, and involve the modeling community in the development of a public good.

There are many ways that you may wish to join the initiative, such as:
* Assigning models in courses you teach
* Replication projects
* Etc.
